# Healthcare Readmission Analysis (Excel + SQL)

## Overview
This project analyzes hospital readmission data to identify high-risk conditions and patient patterns.  
Excel was used for data cleaning, pivot analysis, and charts, while SQL was used to validate key findings.

## Tools Used
- Excel (data cleaning, pivot tables, charts)
- SQL (analysis queries)
- Git & GitHub (version control)

## Excel Analysis
- Cleaned raw healthcare data
- Created pivot tables for readmission analysis
- Built charts for:
  - Readmissions by Diagnosis
  - Readmissions by Risk Flag

## Key Findings
- Heart failure has the highest number of readmissions
- High-risk patients show higher readmission counts
- Readmission patterns vary across diagnoses

## SQL Analysis
SQL queries were written to validate Excel insights, including:
- Readmissions by diagnosis
- Readmissions by risk flag

## Learning Outcome
- Learned proper data organization
- Practiced Excel-based analysis and visualization
- Used SQL to validate analytical results
- Followed a real-world data analyst workflow
